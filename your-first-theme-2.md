#Your First Theme - Part 2

<link to last post>

##Where we are at
Ok so in our last post we finished with you technically having a WordPress theme but the only thing it did was to say "This will work" on the home page. In this post we will add a header, footer, and list your posts on the home page using the default WP_Query and Loop.

So fire up your local environment and lets get to work.

##Base Structure
All websites have a head and a footer ( even if they appear not to ). These two components consist of everything the is exactly the same ( for the most part ) at the top and bottom of a page.  Lets start by creating a header.php and a footer.php in `<your-theme>` directory.

In these files simply type "header" and "footer" respectively so we can see that they are loading in our next step.
